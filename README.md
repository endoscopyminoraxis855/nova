# Nova

**The personal AI that actually learns from its mistakes.**

Correct Nova once. It remembers forever. Correct it enough times, it fine-tunes itself into a smarter model. All on your hardware. Your data never leaves.

```
You: "What's the capital of Australia?"
Nova: "Sydney"
You: "That's wrong, it's Canberra"
Nova: [saves lesson, generates DPO training pair, updates knowledge graph]

--- 3 months later, different conversation ---

You: "What's the capital of Australia?"
Nova: "Canberra"  ← learned permanently
```

No other AI assistant does this.

## Why Nova

Nova is a sovereign personal AI that runs entirely on your hardware with zero cloud dependencies. It doesn't just answer questions — it gets permanently smarter through a self-improvement pipeline that no other open-source project has:

| | Nova | OpenClaw (216K stars) | Khoj (32K stars) | Open WebUI (124K stars) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Learns from corrections | **Full pipeline** | No | No | No |
| Fine-tunes itself | **DPO + A/B eval** | No | No | No |
| Knowledge graph | **Temporal** | No | Experimental | No |
| Hybrid retrieval | **Vector + BM25 + RRF** | No | Vector only | Vector only |
| Zero cloud dependency | **Yes (bundled Ollama)** | No (needs API keys) | Partial | Partial |
| Prompt injection defense | **4-category detection** | No (CVE'd) | No | No |
| Messaging channels | **4 (all with allowlisting)** | 22+ | 3 | 0 |
| Proactive monitors | **14 scheduled** | Heartbeat | Automations | No |
| MCP (client + server) | **Both** | No | No | Client only |

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker + Docker Compose, NVIDIA GPU (20GB+ VRAM), NVIDIA Container Toolkit

```bash
# Clone and start
git clone https://github.com/HeliosNova/nova.git
cd nova_
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d

# Pull models (one-time)
docker exec nova-ollama ollama pull qwen3.5:27b            # Main model
docker exec nova-ollama ollama pull nomic-embed-text-v2-moe # Embeddings
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` — that's it.

### Optional models for routing

```bash
docker exec nova-ollama ollama pull qwen3.5:9b   # Vision model
docker exec nova-ollama ollama pull qwen3.5:4b   # Fast model (greetings, simple queries)
```

## How It Works

```
User query -> brain.think()
  -> load context (history + facts + lessons + skills + knowledge graph)
  -> classify intent (regex, no LLM call)
  -> retrieve documents (ChromaDB vectors + SQLite FTS5 + Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
  -> build system prompt (8 prioritized blocks with truncation budget)
  -> generate response (Ollama / OpenAI / Anthropic / Google)
  -> tool loop if needed (max 5 rounds, 21 tools available)
  -> stream tokens via SSE
  -> post-response: correction detection, fact extraction, reflexion, curiosity
```

No LangChain. No LangGraph. No agent frameworks. ~74 files of async Python + httpx + FastAPI.

## The Learning Loop

This is what makes Nova unique. Every conversation makes it smarter:

1. **Correction Detection** (2-stage) — regex pre-filter + LLM confirmation extracts what was wrong and what's correct
2. **Lesson Storage** — topic, wrong answer, correct answer, lesson text — retrieved on future similar queries
3. **DPO Training Pairs** — every correction generates `{query, chosen, rejected}` data for fine-tuning
4. **Reflexion** — silent failure detection (bad tool choices, hallucinations, exhausted loops) stored as warnings
5. **Curiosity Engine** — detects knowledge gaps ("I don't know", hedging, tool failures), queues background research
6. **Success Patterns** — high-quality responses (score >= 0.8) stored as positive reinforcement
7. **Automated Fine-Tuning** — when enough pairs accumulate, runs DPO training with A/B evaluation before deploying

```bash
python scripts/finetune_auto.py --check   # Check readiness
python scripts/finetune_auto.py           # Full pipeline: train -> eval -> deploy
```

## Channels

Talk to Nova where you already are:

| Channel | Type | Config |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Discord** | Bot (websocket) | `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` |
| **Telegram** | Bot (polling) | `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` |
| **WhatsApp** | Webhook (Business API) | `WHATSAPP_API_URL`, `WHATSAPP_API_TOKEN` |
| **Signal** | Polling (signal-cli) | `SIGNAL_API_URL`, `SIGNAL_PHONE_NUMBER` |

All channels support phone-number allowlisting, message splitting, and graceful reconnection.

## Heartbeat Monitors

14 proactive monitors run on schedule — Nova works even when you're not talking to it:

| Monitor | Schedule | What it does |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Morning Check-in | Daily | Greeting + agenda |
| System Health | 2h | Memory, disk, Ollama status |
| Self-Reflection | Daily | Quality self-assessment |
| Science / Tech / Events / Finance | 8-12h | Domain research → KG triples |
| World Awareness | 4h | Global news monitoring |
| Lesson Quiz | 6h | Self-tests on learned lessons |
| Skill Validation | 12h | Tests skill effectiveness |
| Curiosity Research | 1h | Researches queued knowledge gaps |
| Auto-Monitor Detector | Daily | Detects new monitoring needs |
| System Maintenance | Daily | Decays stale data, prunes |
| Fine-Tune Check | Weekly | Reports when ready for retraining |

## Knowledge Graph

Temporal knowledge graph with structured facts:

- 20 canonical predicates (`is_a`, `located_in`, `created_by`, etc.)
- `valid_from` / `valid_to` — when a fact was true
- `superseded_by` — tracks how facts change over time
- `provenance` — which source/conversation created it
- `query_at(entity, timestamp)` — what was true at a specific time
- Auto-curation: heuristic + LLM pass removes garbage triples

## MCP Integration

Nova is both an MCP **client** and **server** — unique in the landscape:

**As client:** Drop MCP tool configs in `/data/mcp/` and Nova discovers and uses them.

**As server:** Exposes 5 tools for Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client:
- `nova_memory_query` — search user facts and conversations
- `nova_knowledge_graph` — query the KG
- `nova_lessons` — retrieve learned lessons
- `nova_document_search` — search indexed documents
- `nova_facts_about` — get user profile facts

## Multi-Provider LLM

Switch providers with one env var:

| Provider | Config | Default Model |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Ollama** (default) | `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` | qwen3.5:27b |
| **OpenAI** | `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` + key | gpt-4o |
| **Anthropic** | `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic` + key | claude-sonnet |
| **Google** | `LLM_PROVIDER=google` + key | gemini-2.0-flash |

Automatic model routing: fast model for greetings, heavy model for complex reasoning, vision model for images.

## Security

Built with [OWASP Agentic Security](https://genai.owasp.org/) in mind:

**4-tier access control:**

| Tier | Shell | Files | Code | Default |
|------|-------|-------|------|---------|
| `sandboxed` | Blocked | `/data` only | No os/subprocess | Yes |
| `standard` | Limited | `/data`, `/tmp`, `/home` | pathlib only | |
| `full` | Most allowed | Broad | Minimal restrictions | |
| `none` | All | All | All | Dev only |

**Defense in depth:**
- Prompt injection detection (4 categories: role override, instruction injection, delimiter abuse, encoding tricks) with Unicode normalization and homoglyph detection
- SSRF protection on HTTP fetch (blocks RFC 1918, loopback, link-local, IPv4-mapped IPv6, checks after redirects)
- HMAC-SHA256 skill signing (`REQUIRE_SIGNED_SKILLS=true` by default)
- Training data poisoning prevention (channel gating + confidence threshold)
- Anti-sycophancy (refuses to override computed results)
- Docker hardening (read-only root, no-new-privileges, all capabilities dropped)
- Auth rate-limiting with IP lockout (10 failures → 5min lockout)
- Security headers on all responses (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
